</a>

<a name="immobileHelp">
<h2>How To Immobilize the Priest</h2>
<p>
Pulverize the enemy Priest with your <a href="#unitHelp">battle units</a>.  When you've reduced him to half of his 
<a href="#statsHelp">Hit Points</a>,
he'll stop moving, drop anything he's carrying, and a thin force field will form around him, keeping him alive.
<p>
A Priest will not be able to cast a <a href="#buriedType">Spell</a> while immobilized nor will he be able 
to <a href="#vesselPriestHelp">construct buildings</a>.
<p>
Notice that the Priest is constantly regenerating Hit Points, so be sure to keep up a steady barrage
or he may regenerate himself enough to flee.
<p>
Next: <a href="#pickupHelp">Use a Transport to pick him up and carry him to your Altar.</a>
<br>
</a>

<a name="pickupHelp">
<h2>How To Bring the Enemy Priest to your Altar</h2>
<p>
Once immobilized, you can send a <a href="#transportHelp">Transport</a> to pick up the Priest.
(Exception: a Priest cannot pick up another Priest.)
<p>
The Priest must be damaged to at least fifty percent, otherwise he will resist being captured.
<p>
When your Transport returns to the Altar, the enemy Priest will be chained in the Sacrificial Circle.
<p>
Note that the Priest draws new life force from whatever Transport is carrying him, and therefore the Priest will be
fully healed and un-paralyzed when released by the Transport.
<p>
Next: <a href="#moveyourpriestHelp">Send your own Priest to the Altar.</a>
<br>
</a>

<a name="moveyourpriestHelp">
<h2>How To Send Your Own Priest to the Altar</h2>
<p>
You need a Priest to slaughter a Priest.
<p>
At any time, you may move your Priest to your <a href="#altarType">Altar</a>. If he is ever there at a time when you have an
enemy Priest chained in the Sacrificial Circle, the Sacrifice will commence.
To move the Priest to the Altar, left-click on him and then left click on the Altar.  If an Enemy Priest is bound on
the Altar, notice that your cursor appears as
a dagger when positioned over the Altar.  
<p>
In single-player mode, you Sacrifice a Priest to win.  In <a href="#multiQuickHelp">multiplayer</a> mode, you Sacrifice a Priest
to gain new <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a> for your next battle, or to Upgrade your Altar for a chance at
even better Knowledge
<p>
In multiplayer mode, at the moment the Sacrifice begins, you must choose a gift from the Furies.
<p>
Your gift can be new Knowledge which the Furies will
grant you immediately upon completion of the Sacrifice.
<p>
A different gift allows you to Upgrade your Altar.  Better Altars grant better Knowledge from
the Furies.  Note that you will only be able to Upgrade an Altar on your home island, because it is the only 
island that will persist from battle to battle.
<p>
Next: <a href="#performsacrificeHelp">Perform the Sacrifice.</a>
<br>
</a>

<a name="performsacrificeHelp">
<h2>How to Perform the Sacrifice</h2>
<p>
Your Priest must ward five runes to complete the Sacrifice. If he is rendered immobile during the
Sacrifice the Spell will be broken and the enemy Priest will escape. Likewise, if the Altar takes
too much damage the enemy Priest will also escape.
<p>
When the Sacrifice is complete you will be granted your gift: New Knowledge or an Upgraded Altar,
as appropriate.  When new Knowledge is granted the Altar is consumed. You will need to build
a new one to Sacrifice again.  
<p>
If you opt for an Upgraded Altar but do not have the chance to use it 
in this battle, have no fear: this Upgraded Altar will remain on your
home island for use in your next on-line encounter.  Note that you will 
only be able to Upgrade an Altar on your home island, because it is the only 
island that will persist from battle to battle.

<p>
Note that when you Sacrifice for Knowledge, it becomes instantly available to you, ready to be put into
production by the proper Workshop.  Press F6 to Review your new Knowledge.  
<p>
If you gain this Knowledge in <a href="multiQuickHelp">Multiplayer mode</a>, it is yours permanently, 
and will be available in future multiplayer battles.  
But in future battles, it will not appear instantly in your Production Window: you will need to put this 
Knowledge into production in <a href="#factoryHelp">a Workshop</a> in order to make it available.

The world of Nimbus is composed of three spheres: the <a href="#serenisphereHelp">Serenisphere</a>,
the <a href="#pyrosphereHelp">Pyrosphere</a> and the <a href="#deusphereHelp">Deusphere</a>.
<p>
<c>*</c> In the <a href="#serenisphereHelp">Serenisphere</a> you'll match up with your on-line opponents.

<h2>Deusphere</h2>
<p>
In the Deusphere the Furies themselves do eternal battle.  
<p>
The Deusphere is the innermost <a href="#sphereHelp">sphere of Nimbus</a>: where the 
<a href="#themeHelp">Furies</a> rage against one another in a constant war, hurling
land up from the planet below.  Pray that you never fall down into

The Serenisphere is the outermost <a href="#sphereHelp">sphere of Nimbus</a>: a peaceful place to match up
with fellow players for battle in the Pyrosphere below.
<p>
The Serenisphere contains <a href="#battleIslandType">Challenge Rings</a>. <c>Right-click</c> on a ring to join the battle. You'll
join at whatever location you selected.
<p>
Below you will see <a href="zoneHelp">Zones</a>. You'll start at a Zone that roughly matches your Knowledge

rules of a battle and can also kick others off of the ring. Anybody kicked off of a Challenge
Ring cannot rejoin until the BattleMaster leaves.
<p>
When everyone else has joined and is ready to go, the BattleMaster must hit 'Start Battle' to 
descend to the Pyrosphere for full-on battle.  
<p>
Before a battle can commence, all players must click on the colored boxes near their names. Your color
in battle will be the same as your box color.

The Pyrosphere is the central <a href="#sphereHelp">sphere of Nimbus</a>.  It is 
here that you'll square off against your opponents.
<p>
Your goal is to capture <a href="#priestType">High Priests</a> from your opponents and

<p>
As you do battle in the Pyrosphere <a href="#buriedType">Obelisks</a>

<h2>Chat Window</h2>
<p>
You can talk to other players when you activate the Chat Window by hitting <c>F3</c>. Type
your message and hit <b>ENTER</b> to send it to the Chat Windows of other
players!
<p>
If you'd rather not see what a certain player is typing, right-click on that
player's island or units and select <c>Ignore Chat</c>.
<p>
Normally, everyone nearby sees your chat messages. You may restrict who gets
your messages by typing their name followed by a colon (:). You can also type <c>battle:</c>
to send messages to everyone in your <a href="#battleIslandType">Challenge Rings</a>, 
<c>allies:</c> to send to allies only, or if you're an observer, you can type <c>Observer:</c> 
and it will be sent to observers only.
<p>
There are ways to tell if someone is whispering to you, to you and others, or to a group of people. 
You can see who they are talking to by looking at the icon before their name in the chat box:<br>
Whispering to more than one person will have ~[I93.113]<br>
Whispering to one person will have ~[I93.111]<br>
Whispering to Observers will have ~[I93.112]<br>
Whispering to the Battle will have ~[I93.109]<br>
Whispering to Allies will have ~[I93.110]
<p>
If you hit the <c>TAB</c> key the game will automatically search for a name that is
closest to what you already typed. For example, if I wanted to send a message to a player
called "OzTheGreatAndPowerful" I definitely don't want to type his whole name!  So I just
type in "oz" and hit <c>TAB</c> and his whole name appears automatically.
<p>
You can make your chat messages more distinctive by using
the <a href="#formatCommandHelp">.format command</a> to change
your message color and style.
<p>
You can read more about some chat options in the <a href="#chathelperHelp">Chat Helper</a> section.

<h2>Storm Power Available Window</h2>

<q>"Storm Power is the Essence! Creation and Destruction become one!" -Tenth Circle Teachings</q>
<p>
This number shows your available <a href="#stormPowerHelp">Storm Power</a>, used to build 
<a href="#unitHelp">units</a> and Buildings.
<p>
if you have less than 2000<!"fortgump.3"> remaining, the number shows in yellow (for example, <~y>1900<~.><!"fortgump.3">).
If you have less than 1000<!"fortgump.3">, it shows in red (for example, <~r>850<~.><!"fortgump.3">).
<p>
The icon <!"fortgump.3"> is used to indicate amounts of Storm Power. If you are trying to
build something and its Storm Power requirements are drawn in red (for example
"Cannon <~r>1000<~.><!"fortgump.3">") then you do not have enough Storm Power to build it.
<p>
In the <a href="#teleportViewHelp">Production Window</a> units will blink if you attempt

<h2>Bridge</h2>
<p>
<q>"We don't build bridges to make peace." -General Jan Masaryk</q>
<p>
In the <a href="#pyrosphereHelp">Pyrosphere</a> (i.e. in battle), you will build bridges out from the edges
of your island. 
<p>
When you build a Temple, bridge pieces will appear in 
the <a href="#teleportViewHelp">Production Window</a> at the upper-left of your screen.
When a bridge piece first appears in the Production Window it is cracked, but if the piece
remains in the Window for a few seconds it becomes more solid.  The implications and subtleties
of using 
cracked bridge pieces versus solid ones will become clear as you experiment with each in battle.
<p>
Rather than selecting each bridge separately on the <a href="#teleportViewHelp">Production Window</a>, simply use the Q, W, A, S, Z, X, and E keys.
Each key corresponds to an adjacent bridge. Pressing the E key allows the user to select any available bridge unit. 
To rotate a bridge 90 degrees simply right-click with the mouse and to activate reverse bridge rotation, press the C key.
A bridge piece will go red
if it's not legal to lay it down in a particular place.
<p>
Use bridges to connect to resources, to assault enemy islands, and to create territory where you can
lay your <a href="#unitHelp">units</a>.  Remember that stationary units are placed at the <i>end</i> of bridges,
never directly on them!
<p>
Rules to remember: There must be a continuous attachment from the <a href="#vortexHelp">Temple</a> 
on your island to the bridge you are laying down.  Also, bridges cannot be attached to an island if 
an <a href="#edgeFarmType">Edge Farm</a> stands in the way.
<p>
In Multiplayer mode you can cause <a href="generatorHelp">Generators</a> to Meltdown to slightly damage enemy units or break
through bridges by right-clicking the unit and selecting Meltdown.

<a name="teleportViewHelp">
<h2>Production Window</h2>
<p>
Pick up <a href="unitHelp">units</a> from the Production Window by left-clicking, and
left-click again to lay them down on an island or bridge spur.

build them.
<p>
Any <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a> that you have put into production in a

<h2>.Format Command</h2>
<p>
When you type .format in the Chat Window and follow it with text, that text will 
appear before any chat message you send from then on. For example, in the Chat Window type
<br>
.format ~~y~~E
<br>
and hit <b>ENTER</b>. All of your chat messages will now be ~y~Eyellow and embossed~N~.! You can use other
lowercase letters for colors as well, such as
<br>
~b~~b  Blue~.
<br>
~l~~l  Light Blue~.
<br>
~d~~d  Teal~.
<br>
~r~~r  Red~.

~y~~y  Yellow~.
<br>
~i~~i  Light Yellow~.
<br>
~t~~t  Silver~.
<br>
~~.  Resets the color. (That is Tilde + Period)
<p>
Some uppercase letters have meaning as well, for example, if you type
<br>
.format ~~E~~y
<br>
your chat messages will all be ~y~Eyellow and embossed~N~.. Other styles include
<br>
~I~~I  Italicizes text.~N
<br>
~B~~B  Bolds text.~N
<br>
~E~~E  Embosses all of your chat text.~N
<br>
~S~~S  Strikeouts all of your chat text.~N
<br>
~U~~U  Underlines all of your chat text.~N

<h2>Chat Helper</h2>
<p>
<h3>What is the Chat Helper?</h3>
The Chat Helper is the small button to the left of the <a href="#chatViewHelp">Chat Window</a>. Clicking on it brings up
a menu of functions and options to let you decide what you are able to see in the Chat Window and 
to help you create effects for your own text.
<p>
<h3>Format</h3>
The Format menu gives you two options: <c>Edit Back Format</c>, and <c>Edit Front Format</c>. <c>Edit Back Format</c>
brings up a text box in which you can put the text and codes you want to appear before your name in the 
Chat Window. <c>Edit Front Format</c> also brings up a text box, but instead allows you to input the text and
codes you want to appear in front of your name in the <a href="#chatViewHelp">Chat Window</a>.<br>
<br>
This is an alternative way to using the .back, .format and .front commands.
<p>
<h3>Chat Effects</h3>
The Chat Effects menu allows you to decide which effects will be displayed or not
and whether sounds will be played or not when you receive text from other users featuring 
these codes. There are four options:
<p>
<c>Allow Chat Sound:</c> Turning this off will prevent sounds sent by other users from being played.
<p>
<c>Allow Background Colors:</c> Turning this off will stop background colors received from being
displayed, ~E~[B.3]such as this.
<p>
<c>Allow Foreground Colors:</c> Turning this off will stop foreground colors received from being
displayed which use the ~~[C.xxx] code, ~[C.52]such ~[C.156]as ~[C.223]these~., but it leaves
the regular colors, such as ~y~~y~. and ~r~~r~..
<p>
<c>Allow Embossed Offset:</c> Turning this off will prevent any adjusted Emboss effects from being
displayed (those which use the ~~[E.X#xY#] command)
<p>
<h3>Chat Controls</h3>
These options are only available inside a game, and they allow you to decide which channels you can 
receive text from, and which actions should be performed when a new message is received.
<p>
<h3>Channel Controls</h3>
<c>Show General Channel:</c> Disabling this means you do not receive text which is sent to everybody.
<p>
<c>Show Allies Channel:</c> Disabling this means that you do not receive text which is sent through the <c>ALLIES:</c> Channel.
<p>
<c>Show Observer Channel:</c> Disabling this means that you do not receive text which is sent through the <c>OBSERVER:</c> Channel.
<p>
<c>Show Whisper Channel:</c> Disabling this means that you do not receive text from anyone whispering to you.
<p>
<h3>Player Controls</h3>
<c>Show Allies Chat:</c> Disabling this means that you do not receive text from your Allies inside a game.
<p>
<c>Show Enemies Chat:</c> Disabling this means that you do not receive text from your Enemies inside a game.
<p>
<c>Show Observers Chat:</c> Disabling this means that you do not receive text from the Observers inside a game.
<p>
<h3>Other Controls</h3>
<c>Open Window on Message:</c> Disabling this means that the Chat Window does not open when a message is received.
<p>
<c>Play sound on Message:</c> Disabling this means that sounds aren't played when a message is Received.
<p>
<h3>Insert</h3>
This menu allows you to insert certain codes into the Chat Window which  change the colors of,
or which give certain effects to, your text. You can  learn how to use these in the <a href="#formatCommandHelp">.format section</a>.
These are the menus:

<h2>Tactics in NetStorm</h2>
It is crucial to understand how your <a href="unitHelp">units</a> will fight in battle.
Your strategy will depend upon these facts.
<p>
All units will always choose the closest available target. Once locked, they will keep at it
until destroyed.  Certain defensive units, like Towers, can be interposed to force the attacker to
choose a new target. The closest target will be chosen <i>even if it is invulnerable to the attacker</i>!
<p>
When a unit explodes cracked bridge nearby will also crumble. Normal bridge that was adjacent
to the unit will crack, or become a jagged end.
<p>
When shooting units explode they also damage every other unit nearby! They may explode from that damage in
a chain reaction. Temples also explode in this way.
<p>
<a href="salvageHelp">Salvaging</a> a unit does not cause such an explosion,
but bridge is affected in the same way, as if the unit had exploded.
<p>
You can build units 1) on your home island, 2) on any un-owned island which is connected by bridges to your 
home island, or 3) off of any bridge that you own.
<p>
When you destroy an enemy unit you get 25% of its Storm Power value. Remember that 
Whirligigs and Man o' War cost no additional Storm Power to build, and thus return none to you
when destroyed. Only their bases will do so.
<p>
When you are targeting an enemy, remember that you must shoot the area where it meets the <i>ground</i>.
If your shots are hitting its upper areas, then you're not really shooting it at all.
</a>
</a>

<a name="salvageHelp">
<h2>Salvaging</h2>
<p>
You may Salvage any unit and recoup 25% of the Storm Power you spent to build it.
<p>
If the <a href="unitHelp">unit</a> has been damaged, you will recoup less Storm Power. For example, if
you build a unit for 400<!"fortgump.3"> you can Salvage it for 100<!"fortgump.3">. However, if one third of
its hit points are gone, you'll only get 66<!"fortgump.3">.
<p>
One last thing to know: If the damage goes beyond half of the unit's hit points
you will recoup no Storm Power at all.
<p>
Note: Salvaging a unit next to a bridge will make solid bridges crack, and cracked bridges fall.

<h2>Unit Information</h2>
<p>
<b><c>Alignment:</c></b> Each <a href="unitHelp">unit</a> in the game is aligned with one of the <a href="#themeHelp">Furies</a>
or with Sun. The unit's alignment determines what Fury grants <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a> for it, 
what <a href="#factoryHelp">Workshop</a>
can produce it, and what sort of <a href="#influenceHelp">Energy</a> is required to build it.
<p>
<b><c>Class:</c></b> Describes what the unit does and how it can be used. A list of classes appears at the
bottom of this page.
<p>
<b><c>Hits:</c></b> Tells how much damage the unit can absorb before being destroyed.
<p>
<b><c>Range:</c></b> If the unit shoots or spreads an effect, this number tells how many 'tiles'
the effect will reach.  For reference, the size of a Sun Disc Thrower is 3x3 'tiles' and the 
screen is forty tiles high.
<p>
<b><c>Damage:</c></b> Describes how much damage the unit will inflict, on average, every second. Remember,
the rating isn't a per-shot rating, but an absolute scale telling you the unit's effectiveness over time.
<p>
<b><c>Cost in Storm Power:</c></b> Tells how much Storm Power you must expend in order to build the unit.
<p>
<b><c>Energy to Build:</c></b> Shows you how much <a href="#influenceHelp">Energy</a> is required 
to create the unit and exactly which types of Energy are needed.

<p>
Use your Altar to <a href="#sacrificeOutline">Sacrifice</a> captured <a href="#priestType>Priests</a> to the <a href="#themeHelp">Furies</a>.
<p>
Your Priest can build an Altar. Each Altar has five runes - Sun, Wind, Rain, Thunder and Storm - which
must be filled in order to complete a Sacrifice. As each rune is filled, one of the supporting bridges
leaves the center and when all five are gone, the enemy Priest plunges into the abyss.
<p>
In the <a href="#campaignHelp">Campaign</a> when you Sacrifice all the enemy Priests, the 
mission will usually end successfully.
<p>
In <a href="multiplayerHelp">Multiplayer</a> mode Sacrificing has a different meaning. You Sacrifice to
get Knowledge from the Furies.  In order to get higher level units, you must Upgrade your Altar (by
Sacrificing). The
Upgraded Altar (there is a level two and a level three Altar) will stay with your island from
game to game. (Note that you will not be able to Upgrade an Altar that is not on your home island.)  
Your Altar's level must match the level of the unit you're trying to get from the Furies.
Here is a <a href="unitHelp">table</a> of every unit and its level.
<p>
Note that when an Altar is destroyed, a captive Priest will go free.

Your High Priest is the ultimate vessel of Knowledge and power from the <a href="#themeHelp">Furies</a>.
Your Priest can build special buildings and Altars, and also performs Sacrifices of other Priests
to the Furies.
<p>
A Priest can only be destroyed on an Altar.  He cannot be killed by battle units, only incapacitated. 
Furthermore, if the Priest has a <a href="#vortexHelp">Temple</a> his wounds will gradually heal during battle.

<h2>The Three Furies of Nimbus</h2>
<p>
At the heart of Nimbus a constant storm rages. There the three Furies, Wind, Rain and Thunder,
strive in never-ending conflict for control of the <a href="#sphereHelp">world</a>.
<p>
This conflict
tears huge chunks of the Hidden Planet up into the sky. Upon these newborn islands live the Nimbians, your people.
<p>
Death and destruction please the Furies. Thus, when you destroy an enemy unit, you are granted one quarter
of the Storm Power value of that enemy <a href="#unitHelp">unit</a>--except for individual Aerial Attackers which
do not actually cost any Storm Power to build.  
<p>
Even more pleasing to the Furies is the
<a href="#sacrificeOutline">Sacrifice of a Priest</a>. Such Sacrifices cause them to grant the gift of 
battle <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a>.
<p>
Each Fury has a symbol for its <a href="#influenceHelp">Energy</a>:<br>
<!"mana.8"> - Wind<br>
<!"mana.9"> - Rain<br>
<!"mana.10"> - Thunder<br>
<p>
There is also common Knowledge called "Sun," symbolized by <!"mana.11">. <a href="#unitHelp">Sun units</a> can
use any type of <a href="#influenceHelp">Energy</a> but are relatively weak.
<p>
Beyond Sun Knowledge each Fury can supply specialized Knowledge. This Knowledge

<q>"They add a little spice to the carnage."  -Oltor Hammershold, Nimbian battle-cook.</q>
<p>
Transports can acquire and cast Spells that have special effects in the world.
<p>
Spells manifest in the world as Obelisks.  Left-click your Transport and then position the cursor over an Obelisk.  
Left-click again when the hand-cursor appears, and now your Transport will travel to the Obelisk and acquire a Spell. 
Each transport can possess one Spell.  An icon for that Spell will then appear overlaid
on the Transport.
<p>
Once a Transport has acquired a Spell, it can cast the Spell an unlimited number of times, provided the player has
sufficient Storm Power.  The Transport keeps that Spell until destroyed, or until he acquires another Spell--displacing
the previous one.  
Left-click on the Transport to see the 
range of the Spell.  Right-click on the Transport to cast the Spell.
<p>
Once you cast the Spell, your Transport will halt in place until the Spell is cast.  This will 
take a couple of seconds.  
<p>
Spells are more common in <a href="#multiplayerHelp">multiplayer</a> mode than in the Campaign.

Workshops build your <a href="#unitHelp">units</a> for battle.
<p>
You'll build Workshops in battle to construct combat units based on the <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a> that 
you've gained from Sacrificing <a href="#priestType">High Priests</a>.  This Knowledge carries over from
battle to battle so that your diversity and power of units can increase over time.
<p>
Each Workshop can build only
a few units so choose carefully!
<p>
On a new, Level I Workshop you'll have two "Production Slots."  When you choose a new
Knowledge to build, you are filling up one of the slots.  Once you've chosen what a Workshop will build, you can't change
it.
<p>
<I>But</I>, you get one additional slot each time  you <a href="#upgradeHelp">Upgrade</a> a Workshop. In order to Upgrade you must
pay a certain amount of <a href="#moneyHelp">Storm Power</a>.
<p>
When a Workshop creates a unit, a Storm Power Stream streaks from the Workshop to the build site. When it combines
with the proper <a href="#influenceHelp">Energy</a> the unit will be created on the spot. However, if the Workshop is
destroyed you will lose the ability to build anything that Workshop was making until you build another Workshop to replace it.

<h2>Knowledge</h2>

Knowledge gives you the ability to build <a href="#unitHelp">units</a> in Battle.  In <a href="multiQuickHelp">Multiplayer</a> mode, your accumulated
Knowledge persists from each on-line battle to the next.
<p>
Once you've acquired Knowledge by <a href="#sacrificeOutline">Sacrificing High Priests</a>, you can put that
Knowledge into production in any <a href="#factoryHelp">Workshop</a> of the appropriate 
<a href="#themeHelp">Fury alignment</a>.
<p>
From the outset, you are granted the Knowledge for the <a href="#sunarcherType">
Disc Throwers</a> and <a href="#suncannontype">Sun Cannons</a> which you may then put into production
with your first Workshop.  Everything else will cost you the <a href="#sacrificeOutline">Sacrifice</a> 
of some number of Priests.  
<p>
Once you've killed some Priests in exchange for the Knowledge you want, that Knowledge will 
be available to you when you build the appropriate Workshop.  
<p>
For instance, I kill three Priests
in exchange for the ability to build Thunder Cannons.  Now when I build a Thunder Workshop, I can choose
to fill one of my slots with Thunder Cannons.
<p>
But if I build a Wind Workshop, I won't be able to build my Thunder Cannons there.  Each Workshop can only build
the units corresponding to its alignment: Sun units in Sun Workshops, Thunder units in Thunder Workshops, and so on.
<p>
If you have exhausted all of the available slots for a Workshop, it's time to <a href="#upgradeHelp">Upgrade</a>,
which will increase the number of slots available for additional Knowledge or time to build an additional Workshop.

<h2>Transports</h2>
<p>
Any cargo-bearing <a href="unitHelp">unit</a>, can be Aerial or Ground.
<p>
<h3>Moving the Transport</h3>
<p>
Left-click on a Transport and as you move the cursor around the screen you'll see a cross-hairs any place 
that's legal to move, and a no-circle any place that's illegal.  Left-click someplace legal, and the Transport
will move there.  
<p>
<h3>Picking up Cargo</h3>
<p>
If you left-click your Transport and then move your cursor over an object that you can pick up, your cursor 
becomes a hand.  If you left-click on that object, your Transport will go pick it up for you.
<p>
You can pick up <a href="#nuggetType">Storm Crystals</a>, <a href="#priestType">High Priests</a>, and 
<a href="#buriedType">Spells</a> in the form of <a href="#buriedType">Obelisks</a>.
<p>
Remember: Transports cannot carry both a Priest and a Storm Crystal at the same time.
And a Priest cannot carry another Priest.
<p>
<h3>Dropping Cargo</h3>
<p>
Right-click a cargo-carrying Transport, and choose "Drop ...".  
This does not apply to Spells, which cannot be dropped.
<p>
<h3>Casting Spells</h3>
<p>
Once a Transport has acquired a Spell, it can cast the Spell an unlimited number of times, provided the player has
sufficient Storm Power.  The Transport keeps that Spell until the Transport is destroyed, or until it acquires
another Spell, supplanting the previous one.  Now when you right-click
on your Transport, you'll be offered the option to cast the Spell for the indicated amount of Storm Power.
<p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Transports can carry only one Spell at a time.  
<p>
Ground Transports will only attract one Aerial Attacker at a time--
Buildings and other units attract three at a time.
<p>
<a href="#sunWalkerType">Golem</a> are dumb, and they will walk straight off a bridge if it is broken.  All other Transports stop before 
falling to their deaths.
<p>
If a <a href="#priestType">Priest</a> or a <a href="#rainWalkerType">Crystal Crab</a> is standing on a dangerous bridge,
it will try to move automatically to a safer position.

<h2>The Three Furies of Nimbus</h2>

At the heart of Nimbus a constant storm rages. There the three <a href="#sphereHelp">Furies</a>, Wind, Rain and Thunder,
strive in never-ending conflict for control of the world.
<p>
This conflict
tears huge chunks of the Hidden Planet up into the sky. Upon these newborn islands live the Nimbians, your people.
<p>
Death and destruction please the Furies. Thus, when you destroy an enemy unit, you are granted one quarter
of the Storm Power value of that enemy <a href="#unitHelp">unit</a>--except for individual Aerial Attackers which
do not actually cost any Storm Power to build.  
<p>
Even more pleasing to the Furies is the
<a href="#sacrificeOutline">Sacrifice of a Priest</a>. Such Sacrifices cause them to grant the gift of 
battle <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a>.

Each Fury has a symbol for its <a href="#influenceHelp">Energy</a>:<br>

<p>
There is also common Knowledge called "Sun," symbolized by <!"mana.11">. <a href="#unitHelp">Sun units</a> can

Outposts give you control over an island in <a href="multiQuickHelp">Multiplayer</a> play.
<p>
Use your <a href="#priestType">Priest</a> to create Outposts on islands in multiplayer
games and take them over. When an Outpost is created you gain four benefits:
<p>
1. You may build bridges off of the island containing the Outpost.
<br>
2. The island is warded against enemy construction. No enemy may build on it.
<br>
3. Transports may return Storm Crystals to the Outpost to turn them to Storm Power.
<br>
4. Units can be teleported directly from an Outpost, rather than having to travel the
entire distance from your Workshops.
<p>
The rule for island domination is: The player with the most Outposts on an island dominates. If two
players build simultaneously, the island may still remain unowned until one player creates
another Outpost there.

<h2>Campaign vs. Multiplayer Mode</h2>
<p>
NetStorm has a number of Campaign missions for you to play, as well as a Multiplayer
mode which you can play indefinitely. If you play the "Early Missions" you will be
instructed in the workings of the game.
<p>
<b>Campaign</b>
<p>
In the Campaign you begin each mission with a specific group of Knowledge.  In order to win
you must usually Sacrifice the enemy's <a href="#priestType">High Priest</a> to
the <a href="themeHelp">Furies</a>.  This action vanquishes your enemy and allows you
to advance to the next mission.
<p>
<b>Multiplayer</b>
<p>
In <a href="multiQuickHelp">Multiplayer</a> mode things are slightly different. Your Nimbians start with a simple Knowledge
Profile. Each time you <a href="#sacrificeOutline">Sacrifice</a> an enemy Priest you will
be able to gain new <a href="#technologyHelp">Knowledge</a> to improve your fighting
ability.
<p>
Multiplayer maps are configured differently from those in the Campaign. You'll see that
there are many small islands to control as you attempt to defeat your enemy. The
<a href="#outpostType">Outpost</a> (which does not appear in the Original Campaigns) is instrumental
in winning Multiplayer games.
<p>
The <a href="#altarType">Altar</a> also functions differently
and you should learn about <a href="#challengeIslandType">Zones</a> and being
a <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a>.  If you want

<h2>Rank</h2>
<p>
What divides the true veterans from the beginners?  Rank does.
<p>
Having a higher Rank than another player does not give you any advantages in
battle - it is merely a way of showing your skill and how many Priests you have sacrificed.
<p>
Higher Rank is achieved when you have Sacrificed many Priests and
gained every single piece of Knowledge the Furies can bestow. At this
moment, when you next Sacrifice you will get the option to
<p>
<c>ADVANCE TO RANK X</c>
<p>
The 'X' will be the number of your new Rank. If you choose this option, all of the technologies 
that you have gained whilst advancing to level 43 will be lost, and you will start over again 
with the Sun Disc Thrower, the Sun Cannon, and one Generator. Choosing this option will also increase your Rank by 1.
<p>
In previous versions of Netstorm, Ranks gave players an advantage in battle, by giving their units more health 
and stronger attacking power, but this was considered unfair. This system of stronger units is now used in the 
Handicap system, of which the advantages are decided by the <a href="playerOptionsHelp">Player Settings</a>
the <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a> can set.

You need to know that players with a higher Level than yours
have been playing longer and have won more battles. Be cautious
if they join a game you're playing.
<p>
Even players with low Levels might be veterans. Check out their
Rank by looking next to their name. A player with higher rank
inflicts more damage the higher his Rank, and suffers less
damage from lower Ranked players.
<p>
You can also examine how many games the player has played. To find out,
<c>right-click</c> on the player's island and choose <c>View Player Info</c>
to get details about them. This is probably the best way to tell how good a 
player is, as the players who are the best are those who have been playing for the longest.
<p>
If they have played many more games than you, they are probably much
more experienced than you are.  If you're not on a <a href="battleIslandType">Challenge
Ring</a> then you don't need to be concerned.
<p>
If they are on the same Ring as you are, you have two options if you do not 
want to play with them. First, you can simply leave the Challenge Ring by
<c>left-clicking</c> outside the ring. Second, if you are the 
<a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a> you can right-click their 
name in the left window and Kick them Off, however it is common courtesy
to politely ask a player to leave before using this option.
<p>
It is also wise to check a player's <a href="reliabilityHelp">Reliability Rating</a> before
playing.

<h2>Reliability Ratings</h2>
<p>
Every player gets a Reliability Rating that indicates how often he finishes games.
<p>
At first this may seem unimportant - but consider how disappointing it can be when
your enemy disconnects right at the end of a battle - just so you won't beat
him.
<p>
That is where Reliability Ratings come in. Whenever somebody disconnects from an unfinished
battle and never returns, their Reliability Rating goes down.  Of course, it's
impossible to tell whether they disconnected intentionally, or whether their 
Internet connection is poor.  A disconnect is a disconnect. So a low Reliability 
Rating might just mean you have a flaky Internet connection - not that you're a sore loser.
<p>
You can view a player's Reliability Rating in the Challenge area by <c>right-clicking</c> on
their island.  A Reliability Rating of 100% is as good as it gets. A Rating of 0% means
they have never finished any games!
<p>
If you find yourself with a low Reliability Rating you might consider switching Internet
Service Providers.

<h2>Battle Master</h2>
<p>
The Battle Master can control the <a href="battleOptionsHelp">rules</a> and <a href="playerOptionsHelp">Players Settings</a> of a battle and kick
unruly players off of the <a href="battleIslandType">Challenge Ring</a>
before a battle begins.
<p>
The rules of a battle are shown at the bottom of the left hand
window and the player settings are shown at the top left hand window.
Click on a rule or setting to change it. When a rule or setting is changed
you and all the other players in the battle will become "unchecked."
This is a safety measure to prevent rules and settings changes from slipping past
players undetected. 
<p>
As Battle Master you have the responsibility of creating a good
game for all the players involved. If one player is not appropriate
to your game (perhaps his level is too high) you can Kick him Off the
ring. Just <c>right-click</c> on his name in the window and 
select <c>Yes</c>. However, we ask you to be nice to the fellow players and
try asking them to leave before kicking.
<p>
We urge you to consider the requests of other players on your ring
regarding rules changes. Nobody likes to wait a long time for a battle
to start, and heeding such requests can make everyone happier.
<p>
There is one other extremely important role for you as Battle Master.
Your computer will be the one chosen to route information between the
other players in the game. If you have a slow or poor connection, it
is good etiquette to allow others to become a Battle Master instead.
<p>
Another consideration is your connection speed. If you're hosting a game
of five or more players, you might ask around the ring to see who has the
fastest connection. A fast Battle Master makes a more reliable game for
everyone.

<h2>Challenge Rings</h2>
<p>
<c>Left-click</c> on a Challenge Ring to join that ring.
<p>
If you're the first player on the Challenge Ring, you will become the <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a>, 
as long as the Pass Server Diagnostic option located under Options then Game is selected. Pass Server Diagnostic 
allows you to serve, however, if you are behind a firewall or have a slow connection you may choose to deselect 
this option and disallows you to become a <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a>.
If you are not the first player on the ring you will simply become a member of that battle.
<p>  
If you are behind a firewall but would like to be able to serve NetStorm games you will need to open/forward  
ports <c>6799</c> and <c>6800</c>. There is more help regarding this subject at <a href="http://www.netstormhq.com">Netstorm:HQ</a>.  
<p>
<i>Your location on the challenge ring is your location in the battle!</i>
<p>
When you join the battle, your name will appear in the left window with a colored box next to it and other <a href="playerOptionsHelp">Player Settings</a>.
Your name will first be a gray color until you connect to the <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a>. If your name stays gray color,
then for some reason you can not connect to the Battle Master. Once the gray color goes away the color of the box and your
name is the color you'll have in the battle. To indicate that you're ready to start, click the colored box next to your name.
<p>
Once you clicked the box at first a black circle will appear in the box:   <!"fortgump.L6">
<p>
The circle should light up if your name is not gray. If it lights up this means your computer has
confirmed that it can make a connection to the Battle Master:   <!"fortgump.L7">
<p>
If the black circle never lights up and your name stays gray, you cannot make this connection for some reason.
You will want to leave this battle and join another. In rare circumstances, leaving the
Challenge Ring and rejoining will allow the connection to be established.
<p>
You don't have to join a battle if you don't want to. You can leave a battle ring at any time. The <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a>
has the power to 'kick', however it is common courtesy to politely ask a player to leave
before using this option.
<p>
If a ring has yellow text on it, that means the battle is using a version that is different enough from yours that you may not play together.
<p>
Note: The <a href="#battlemasterHelp">Battle Master</a> can add a description by right clicking the center of the ring and typing into the field.

<h2>Zones</h2>
<p>
NetStorm has many Zones for you to play in.  When you first enter the Pyrosphere you'll
move automatically to a Zone that matches your Level.  If the best Zone for
you has no other players, you'll probably appear in a nearby Zone with somebody in it.
<p>
In each Zone you'll see <a href="#battleIslandType">Challenge Rings</a> and more Zones.
<br>
<!"battleIsland.*">
"Challenge Ring"
<br>
<!"challengeIsland.*"> "Zone"
<p>
If you wish to visit another Zone, examine the words under the Zone. If it says, "Empty"
then there are no other players in that Zone. However, if someone joined the zone recently
you may not be able to tell they joined the zone. Pushing <c>F9</c> will refresh the zones and allow
you to see if anyone joined the zone recently. If there is someone in the zone it will say the number of
players in the zone, and there average level. To travel to another Zone, just <c>left-click</c>
the Zone.
<p>
While in a Zone, click on the player's name on the left window and your
screen will zoom to that player. <c>Left-click</c> near that player and your island
will fly to the new location you've chosen.

<h2>Player List Window</h2>
<p>
If you are floating free in the Pyrosphere you will see the names
of every player present in your <a href="challengeIslandType">Zone</a>.  You can
click on a player's name to see where that player is.
<p>
With each player handle you may see some or all of the following information, and might look like this:
<!"fortgump.L1"><!"fortgump.L0"><~y><~E><~B>1.43 devo12<~.>
<p>
<!"fortgump.L1"> indicates that the player is marked as not being able to be the 
<a href="battleMasterHelp">Battle Master</a> i.e. the server in a multi-player game. 
In short, battles will be more robst the fewer players are fire-walled.
If you are fire-walled yourself, look for battles where most of your opponents are not i.e. the server
in a multi-player game.
<p>
If you see the <!"fortgump.L1"> icon next to your name, but don't think that you are
actually fire-walled, you can get rid of the icon by pressing Esc, clicking Options, 
clicking Game and select the Pass Server Diagnostic option. This means that you can 
be a Battle Master at the start of a game, and that you can take over the role of
<a href="battleMasterHelp">Battle Master</a> in the middle of a game if the current Battle Master disconnects.
<p>
If you do not see the <!"fortgump.L1"> icon next to your name, but you know that you are unable to
serve well, then you can mark yourself as firewalled by unselecting the option mentioned in the previous
paragraph. This will mean that you will never become Battle Master in a game.
<p>
<!"fortgump.L0"> indicates that the player does not have the NetStorm CD currently in 
his or her CD-Rom drive.  Note: On most servers you will not see this icon.
<p>
The numbers before the name, example <c>1.43</c> are the <a href="rankHelp">Rank</a> and level. So therefore
<c>1.43</c> would be rank 1 level 43. The higher the level the more <a href="unitHelp">Units</a> the player 
has. The higher the rank is the longer the player has been playing.
<p>
<~y><~E><~B>devo12<~.> is an example of a player's handle name
<p>
While inside a <a href="battleIslandType">Challenge Ring</a> you may notice icons such as
~[IfortGump.L9] ~[IfortGump.L11] <!"icon.B0">. You can review these icons in the
<a href="playerOptionsHelp">Player Settings</a> section.

<p>
Each player must click the box next to his or her name before the <a href="battlemasterhelp">Battle Master</a>

<p>
If somebody joins and their name stays gray it means they can not connect. When the gray named person clicks 
in their pip will stay dark meaning they cannot establish a connection with the <a href="battlemasterhelp">Battle Master</a> 
and cannot play in that game. Sometimes leaving the <a href="#battleIslandType">Challenge Ring</a> and rejoining will
allow the connection to be established.

<h2>Player Settings</h2>
<p>
Player settings are settings the <a href="battlemasterhelp">Battle Master</a> sets for each player.
<p>
<c>Observer</c> - determines whether the indicated person is fighting or observing the battle. A ~[IfortGump.L9] 
represents that the person is playing, while a ~[IfortGump.L10] represents that the person is observing.
An observer will not have an island, a priest, or Storm Power in the game. The Battle Master can adjust
this setting by clicking on the icon.
<p>
<c>Preset Teams</c> - To create a preset team, the Battle Master can click on the colored shields until the
players on the same team have matching shields. Right clicking a colored shield will make this setting go back.
<br>
The Shields are: ~[IfortGump.L11]~[IfortGump.L12]~[IfortGump.L13]~[IfortGump.L14]~[IfortGump.L15]~[IfortGump.L16]~[IfortGump.L17]~[IfortGump.L18]
<p>
<c>Handicap</c> - The Handicap option allows the Battle Master to strengthen the units of a certain player.
Left and Right clicking the icon forces it to change. 
<br>
The icons from one to ten are: <!"icon.B0"> <!"icon.B1"> <!"icon.B2"> <!"icon.B3"> <!"icon.B4"> <!"icon.B5"> <!"icon.B6"> <!"icon.B7"> <!"icon.B8"> <!"icon.B9">
<br>
Once the rank gets high, it will have two icons and it works just like a number system. The higher the icon the
more strength the player units are. You can check the handicap any time in battle by pressing <c>F9</c> to
bring up the player list. For more information on this you can check <a href="http://www.netstormhq.com">Netstorm:HQ</a>.

<h2>Battle Options</h2>
<p>
Battle options change the initial conditions of a battle.
<p>

<c>Game Options></c> Clicking this text will pop up a drop down menu that will list all the battle options that can be changed in drop down format.<p>

<c>(Sort By)</c> you can click the sort by menu to easily toggle between the battle options viewing.<br> 
<p><c>The Show All Options</c> has the same appearance of older version of NS however clicking the white text will bring up a drop down box allowing you to change the value of the option easily while clicking the tan text will toggle the options by one as seen in prior version of Netstorm.<br>
<p><c>Show Only Changed Options</c>this option will show only the battle options that have been changed from there original default. This option allows you to add battle master option much the same as you would add excluded units. Clicking the white or tan text will reset the battle option to default and remove it from the current viewpoint. <p>
<p>

<c>Game Type</c> - Netstorm as a game over the years has evolved into many branches and with every introduction of a new patch the game dynamics tend to change. Keeping this in mind the concept of Game Types was born. In general Game Types allows you to easily select between different generations of battle styles that have been created over the years. This option also organizes the battle menu into something that is easier to read and easier to configure and auto configures some of the battle options thus making setting up a game quicker and easier. For example <br>
<p>
<c>Netstorm Standard</c> is classified as the most current style of game play. This selection features the newly implemented geyser distribution system and includes battle options that are traditionally associated with Modern Netstorm game play.<br> 
<p>
<c> Netstorm Classic</c> is a highbred between Netstorm 10.64 and Netstorm 10.37 and utilizes the random map geyser distribution system commonly found in older version of the game.<br>
<p>
<c> Netstorm Flexible</c> unlocks 95% of the battle options that can be configured and is very similar to the layout of  Netstorm 10.70<br>
<p>
<c> Netstorm Geyserless</c> is a radical new concept born from the idea of the furies granting the player small amounts of money during the game rather than the player having to worry about collecting. This game style is very new, and can be quite fun.<br>
<p>
<c> Player Customizable</c> allows the player to create there own game style and edit almost every aspect of the game. Who knows maybe you will create a game style that everyone will enjoy playing.
<p>

<c>Bridge Slots</c> - determines how many bridges will appear in
your Production Window during the game.
<p>
<c>Unit Rate</c> - determines how quickly units refresh in your
Production Window. For example, when you lay a unit down in the
game its image in the Production Window will stay dimmed for a 
while. Increase the Unit Rate and it will light up more quickly.
<p>
<c>Generator Range</c> - describes how far a Generator will cast
its energy. A longer range means it's easier to deploy high level
units (but there is less strategy to the game).
<p>
<c>Kill Reward</c> - When you destroy an enemy unit you usually
get one quarter of the Storm Power value of that unit. You can change
the reward value with this option.
<p>
<c>Breakable Alliances</c> - Are players allowed to break alliances once they
have made them?  Normally you cannot break alliances. If you want greater freedom
you can switch this to <c>Yes</c>.
<p>
<c>Allow Send</c> - Are players allowed to send Storm Power to other players? Normally you 
can send Storm Power to other players. If you want to disallow this you can switch this to <c>No</c>.
<p>
<c>Money per Geyser</c> - How much Storm Power will each Geyser
produce?
<p>
<c>Starting Cash</c> - determines how much Storm Power you start with. This is normally set at <c>6500</c>,
however if you feel you need more or less at the start of game you can change this option.
<p>
<c>Geyser Amount</c> - determines how many geysers are in the game. You can change this to have
more or less geysers in the game.
<p>
<c>Spell</c> - Do you want spells in the game? Normally spells are in the game. If you want to disallow spells
you can switch this to <c>No</c>. This option does not affect the priest.
<p>
<c>Map Mode</c> - determines what type of map you want. This is normally set to the traditional multiplayer map
<c>Archipelago</c>, but you can change this to a <c>Single Island</c>.
<p>
<c>Map Size</c> - Changing this option will result in a larger or smaller map size.
<p>
<c>Map Density</c> - determines the size and amount of islands in the game. Higher densities increase the
odds of more and larger islands appearing, while lower densities decrease these odds.
<p>
<c>Island Dynamics</c> - this option if active causes random items such as trees, ruins and monuments to be created allover the map. 
<p>
<c>Geysers Placement</c> - This option toggles between having no geyser on startup or respawning during the game, the old Netstorm geyser mode where geysers could spawn anywhere on the map and the new geyser mode that evenly distributes geysers across the map.
<p>
<c>Geysers Respawns</c> - this option sets how often the respawn geyser could. <p>
<p>
<c>Resource Injections</c> - This option allows the furies to send you storm power at discreet intervals of time. <p>
<p>
<c>Injection Value</c> - This option sets how much storm power the furies will send you per injection. <p>
<p>


<c>Excluded Units</c> - If you don't want to allow a certain unit or building to be
built during your battle, you can exclude them here. Also excluding spells will not allow a particular spell to appear on the map.
